- What does the recognizer do?

The point cloud recognizer recognizes trained multi and single stroke 2d-gestures.
The $P recognizer transforms the strokes into a "point cloud" (a presentation of the strokes as simple points).
That means that the direction and cronological order in which the strokes where drawn is removed and the points that were 
generated from the strokes are in an unordered list.
The recognizer then uses a greedy-5 algorythm to compare the new drawn gesture's point cloud with the learned gestures point clouds
and find the best match. For this the points from the new gesture get paired with points from the trained gestures, and the the best possible
pairing is chosen.

- Name an advantage of the $P recognizer over the $1 recognizer

The dollar 1 recognizer uses the order and direction in which the strokes were drawn, while the $P recogizer discards this information.
Because of this, gestures that are drawn in another direction or with an other stroke order cant be recognized correctly by the $1 recognizer.
For the $P recognizer the order and direction of the gerstures is irrelevant

- What is the minimum matching distance?

As described above, the $P recognizer compares all possible sets of points pairs from the new gestures with all the trained gestures.
He then calculates the distances between the paired points.
The minimum matching distance describes the pair-combination that has the lowest sum of distances between its point pairs.
